## Information

This is a solution for the Landbay assignment.

## Algorithms

Two different strategies were implemented for solving this problem.

### GreedyAlgorithm

Assumptions made:
- Investors always look for the largest mortgage to fund (investments sorted by their size)
- Investors that have the smallest expected annual income from interest get to choose first, when the abstractAlgorithm considers the next investment.

### Evolutionary algorithm

Arguments passed into the algorithm:
- ChromosomeType ---> How the chromosome is represented and how its fitness is calculated
- minimisation ---> whether the algorithm is minimisation or maximisation of the fitness
